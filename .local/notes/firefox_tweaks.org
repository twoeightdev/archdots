#+title: Firefox Tweaks

* Introduction
This file is all about tweaking firefox based on my personal preferences.
First you need to enable =toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets=
in =about:config= in firefox address bar. Then we're going to create two files in
=~/.mozilla/firefox/profile.default-release/chrome/=, First is =userContent.css= then
=userChrome.css=, which some of the customization in this guide will be using
both files.

* Tweaks
** Screen tearing
=layers.acceleration.force-enabled= *true*
** Fix mouse right click
=ui.context_menus.after_mouseup= *true*
** Remove video fullscreen warning
=full-screen-api.warning.timeout= *0*
** Remove pocket
=extensions.pocket.enabled= *false*
** Prevent download panel from opening automatically
=browser.download.alwaysOpenPanel= *false*
